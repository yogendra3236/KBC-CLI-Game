# KBC-CLI Game

In this project, I have made a simple **KBC** Game in **Java** who let you ask some of the questions, and you'll be given four options for that. You have to choose any one of them. If the answer will be right, then you'll be forwarded to the next question, else you'll lose it.

## Requirements
### Installation process 

Run the following commands on your terminal to install java on your linux system.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt update; sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer
```

To check the version of java after installing, that you're using, run -
`javac --version`
